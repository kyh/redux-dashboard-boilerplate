Redux Dashboard Boilerplate
===============
Bootstrap your React/Redux Dashboard with built in Jwt authentication

## Features

* JSX, ES6, and ES7 support with babel.js
* SCSS transformed with PostCSS
* Source maps included in all builds
* Development server with hot reload when possible and refresh otherwise
* Production builds with cache busting and asset minification

## Installation

Install [node](http://nodejs.org/), my favored approach is using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

Clone the repo and change `origin` git remote.

```shell
$ npm install
```

## Usage
The following commands are available in your project:
```bash
# Start for development
npm run dev

# Build the dist version and copy static files
npm run build
```

## Examples

Examples coming soon.

## TODO
- Universal JavaScript rendering
- Test with Karma
